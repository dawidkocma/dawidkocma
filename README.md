<h1>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/DawidKocma">Dawid Kocma</a> 👋</h1>

I'm an **AI Engineer** based in **Liverpool, UK** , specialized in turning complex prototypes into scalable, production-ready solutions. Currently, I am focused on **LLM reliability and RLHF** as a Contractor for **Outlier**, collaborating with partners like Meta AI to reduce hallucinations and ensure technical safety protocols.

I bridge the gap between complex engineering and real-world business operations, ensuring that AI-driven automation delivers measurable value. Whether it’s architecting **MLOps pipelines** or orchestrating **n8n workflows**, I build systems designed for resilience and efficiency.

#### 🌱 What I'm Passionate About

* **Production-Grade AI:** Moving beyond notebooks to deploy robust, event-driven architectures.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Leveraging **n8n** and **LLM APIs** to eliminate manual operational overhead.
* **Continuous Learning:** Currently deepening my expertise in **Azure AI Foundry** and **Terraform in Azure**.


#### 🎖 Key Milestones

* **Enterprise Automation:** Designed a business-critical **n8n screening system** that successfully reduced hiring latency through automated LLM text classification.
* **Cloud Engineering:** Transitioned local models to the cloud, including a **Serverless Housing Valuation API** deployed via AWS S3 for real-world inference.




#### 🚀 Featured Projects

* [**n8n Candidate Screening System**](https://github.com/DawidKocma): Automated data pipeline using LLMs to structure skills from unstructured text.
* [**Serverless Housing Valuation API**](https://github.com/DawidKocma): A production-ready MLOps pipeline using Scikit-Learn for asset pricing.
* [**Real-Time News Aggregator**] [Currently Updating]: Discord Agent - Low-latency NLP agent built with Python and Docker for sentiment analysis and noise filtering.
* **[COMING SOON] Insurance Fraud Detection Engine:** Developing an anomaly detection model targeting common motor insurance fraud patterns (e.g., staged accidents, ghost broking).
